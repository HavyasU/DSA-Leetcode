# 234. Palindrome Linked List

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem

Given the head of a singly linked list, return `true` if it is a palindrome or `false` otherwise.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`.

## Follow up

Can you solve it in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space?
